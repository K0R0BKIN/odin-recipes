    </p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g carrots, peeled and cut into evenly sized pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>Zest and juice of one lemon</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the Carrots: Place the peeled and cut carrots in a medium saucepan. Add enough water to cover them and
            a pinch of
            salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer until the carrots are tender,
            about 8-10
            minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>

        <li>Prepare the Glaze: In the same saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the honey, lemon zest,
            and lemon
            juice. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is smooth and slightly thickened, about 2-3 minutes.​
        </li>

        <li>Glaze the Carrots: Return the cooked carrots to the saucepan with the glaze. Toss to coat the carrots
            evenly. Cook for
            an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the glaze to thicken and adhere to the carrots.​</li>

        <li>Season and Serve: Season the glazed carrots with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Transfer to
            a serving
            dish, garnish with chopped fresh parsley if desired, and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
